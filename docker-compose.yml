# Our top-level volumes key defines the volumes dbdata.
# When Docker creates volumes, the contents of the volume are stored in a part of the host filesystem, /var/lib/docker/volumes/, that’s managed by Docker.
# The contents of each volume are stored in a directory under /var/lib/docker/volumes/ and get mounted to any container that uses the volume.
# In this way, the data that our users will create will persist in the dbdata volume even if we remove and recreate the db container.
